## TRO - The Rookie Organization
---------------------------------------
We are a bunch of nerds, and this is the storehouse for all our projects. Everyone is welcome here to look at what we have to present and fork it to use as you please.
If you want to collaborate on some projects or have random ideas for projects, do reach out!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
